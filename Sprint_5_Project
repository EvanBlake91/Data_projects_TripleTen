#TripleTen Sprint 5 Project - SuperStore Returns

##Saving SuperStore

I was hired as a consultant to discover What is causing the high number of returned orders at the Superstore? 

##The Data

The data is provided by TripleTen in the form of a singular excel sheet with two tables. 
**Returns**, **Orders** and **People**

##The Process

I imported the dataset into Tableau to better visualize the summarization of the data. I had to ensure the data tables were properly joined in order for the information to connect properly 

The Project was broken down into 2 major parts to analyze the data

What is Causing Returns? - using the data set I was able to create a calculated field to find the return rate compared to a variable of my choice. 

Building a Dashboard for Monitoring Returns -

##Results

To conclude this project I made a presentation via loom walking the stakeholders through my findings and recommendations
