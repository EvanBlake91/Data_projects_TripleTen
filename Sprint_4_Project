#TripleTen Sprint 4 Project - Saving SuperStore

This is the 2nd project I worked on in the TripleTen Data Science program. 

##Saving SuperStore

I was "hired" as a consultant to review the superstoreâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy. 

##The Data

The data is provided by TripleTen in the form of a singular excel sheet. 

##The Process

I imported the dataset into Tableau to better visualize the summarization of the data. Since it was all in a single file there was no need to join or relate to any other files. 

The Project was broken down into 3 major aspects to digest the data properly. 

Part 1: Profits & losses- I identified the important centers of profit and loss for the superstore.

Part 2: Advertising- The superstore wanted to know if advertising would be worth it. Using the data set I identified the 3 best state/month combos that would make for a successful advertising campaign.

Part 3: Returned items- Superstore asked me to identify which product and which customers had the highest return rates based on the data. 

##Results

Finally, I created 3 dashboards to better deliver the information back to the SuperStore higherups and submit my recomendations.
